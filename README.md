### Introduction

This dataset is a subset of the [Titanic dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic) which is a large dataset of 
passengers on the Titanic. The Titanic is the world's largest passenger liner, and was supposed to ship around
2,200 people. It sank in the North Atlantic Ocean in 1912. We miss the Titanic, but we can still learn a lot.

This problem is a classification problem. The goal is to predict whether a passenger survived the sinking of the Titanic.
